	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Becoming a software developer has been a dream of mine because I am fascinated by the power of technology to solve real-world problems. I have always been intrigued by how software applications can make life easier, whether itâ€™s through automating tasks, creating immersive digital experiences, or enabling global connectivity. 
        Learning to code allows me to not just consume technology but also to create and contribute to it. The problem-solving, logical thinking, and creative freedom that come with software development excite me every day. 
        I want to become a developer to build solutions that impact people's lives, grow continuously in a rapidly evolving tech landscape, and fulfill my passion for innovation and learning.</p>
